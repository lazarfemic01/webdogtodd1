    <h2>LEARN ABOUT RADON</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>Radon is cancer-causing, radioactive gas.</h3>
     <p class="pradon1">Radon is a chemical element with the symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas. It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive decay chains through which thorium and uranium slowly decay into lead and various other short-lived radioactive elements.</p>
    </div>
</div>


<div>
    <h3>Radon can be found all around the world.</h3>
    <p class="pradon1">Radon is present everywhere in the United States. Levels of the gas differ from state to state, but it is particularly high in North Dakota and Iowa. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Map of Radon Zones shows the potential for elevated radon levels for each county in the United States.</p>
</div>


<div >
    <h3>You should test for radon!</h3>
    <p class="pradon1">A radon test is the only way to find out how much radon is in your home. You can test your home yourself or hire a licensed radon measurement professional, most radon tests can be performed on your own. Hiring a licensed radon measurement professional is recommended when an unbiased, third party is needed, such as in a real estate transaction. The result from a properly performed radon test will help you decide if you need to reduce your home's radon level.</p>

<div>
    <h3>You can fix a radon problem!</h3>
    <p class="pradon1">Radon mitigation systems use a fan to continuously pull air from the soil and exhaust it outdoors through a pipe. The pipe can either run inside or outside the home and discharges outside, away from the windows and openings. In addition, cracks and openings in the foundation are sealed.</p>
